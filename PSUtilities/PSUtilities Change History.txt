1.0 Original Version
1.1 Added regex,backup package

1.3 Added some extra input checking for PSUtilities.date:calculateDateDifference, PSUtilities.file:objectToFile, PSUtilities.math:compareFloats, PSUtilities.math:compareInts, PSUtilities.remote:runContextJob, PSUtilities.remote:runTContextJob
1.4 Updated the floating point math services to address scale issue

2.0 
12 new top level folders
54 new services

Services to cache data and lookup from backend resources for faster performance
Services to query and sort document lists
Services to work on all elements of a document like remove nulls recursively or invoke any other service 
General utility services like get the type of an exception thrown by an adapter service or read configuration from an XML file.
Consistent formatting of code across all the services for better readability.

Package is backward compatible with PSUtilities 1.8 as all new services have been added into a new tree named ps.util.
Very little overlap with the old set of services although wherever the same functionality exists the new services should
be recommended.

2.01 Fixed the ps.util.math:round service to have the proper signature and comments. Also removed the documentation from the pub/doc folder as it available separately. 
Compiled the code again without debug symbols.

2.1 Mainly webMethods 7.1 compatibility changes
Made some changes to the cache services to remove some bugs related to nulls. Also added a new parameter to
control duplicates in cache tables.

Some internal variables have been renamed to avoid conflicts with new reserved words in Java 5.0.

The services in the PSUtilities.ssl folder were using internal APIs that are either not available in Integration Server 
7.1 or have been changed. This folder has been removed to avoid having to maintain two different versions of the PSUtilities package.

Version 2.1 has been compiled with JDK 5.0 but the class files generated are still compatible with JDK 1.4 in order
to ensure that this package can still be used with IS 6.x.

2.2 Fixed bug in caching services which was causing the cache not be be refreshed. Also add encoding and charsetName capabilities 
to the psutil.io services.

2.3 Fixed some incorrect references to services that did not exist.
